Welcome and thank you for reporting an issue!

First:

- Confirm that you are using the latest version of LeakCanary (see https://github.com/square/leakcanary/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
- Verify that your issue hasn't already been reported by searching over all issues: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/issues?q=is%3Aissue.

What kind of issue is this?

 - *Question*: This issue tracker is not the place for questions. If you want to ask how to do
   something, or to understand why something isn't working the way you expect it to, use Stack
   Overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/leakcanary.

 - *Help me fix a leak?*: Please do not file an issue.
   Instead, read here: https://github.com/square/leakcanary/#how-do-i-fix-a-memory-leak
 
 - *Leak analysis failed*: if it's an OutOfMemoryError, no need to report it. See https://github.com/square/leakcanary/wiki/Future#low-memory-leak-analysis

 - *Bug report*: If you’ve found a bug, spend the time to write a failing test. Bugs with tests get fixed.
   Here’s an example: https://gist.github.com/swankjesse/981fcae102f513eb13ed
   
 - *Feature Request*: Start by telling us what problem you’re trying to solve. Don’t send pull requests to implement
   new features without first getting our support. Sometimes we leave features out on purpose to keep the project small.
